        Since I was very young i've had a lifelong interest in technology, and its ability to make life better.  
         My first real job in the tech industry was an afterschool arangement at a independent computer repair shop in downtown Plant City.

        I was thrilled
         to be in contact with more technology than I could inventory. I then proceeded to work at Steak and Shake as a server for about a year, then I 
         became the store manager of a Subway after only 8 months of working there found a job in the industrial electrical sales industry. After a few 
         months working in the warehouse, I was moved up into a sales position. But I knew I really wanted was a job in the technology 
         field, and thats how I got to this point.
